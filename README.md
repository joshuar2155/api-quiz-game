# api-quiz-game

## Description

This project is to utilize javascript to create a quiz game.

- The motivation for this project was to further refine my javascript skills.
- I built this project as an example of different usages of javascript including clicking buttons and choosing options.
- This problem solves concepts of choosing correct and incorrect answers. 
- I learned different methods to use if and else statements in js.

## Usage

This project can be used not only as a small study tool but as a demonstration of diffent js techniques.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
